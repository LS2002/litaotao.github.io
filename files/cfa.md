1. roles of financial reporting and financial statement analysis.
2. balance sheet, statement of financial position or condition: assets = liabilities + owners' equity
3. income statement, statement of operations or the profit and loss statement: revenues, expenses, and other income [ gains and loss ]
4. statement of changes in equity
5. statement of cash flows: operation cfo, investing cfi, financing cff
6. fianancial statement notes, also footnotes
7. management's commentary, also management discussion & analysis
8. audit: unqualified opinion, qualified opinion, adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion;
9. financial statement analysis framework: objective and context -> data -> process data -> analyze and interpret data -> conclusions -> update the analysis



## Reading 22: Financial Reporting Mechanics



1. accounting equation
   1. assets = liabilities + owners' equity
   2. assets = liabilities + (contributed capital + ending retained earnings)
   3. assets = liabilities + (contributed capital + beginning retained earnings + revenue - expenses - dividends)
2. double entry accounting: a transaction has to be recorded in at least 2 accounts
3. accrual accounting: requires that revenue is recorded when the firm earns it and expenses are recorded as the firm incurs thems, regardness of whether or not the cash has been paid. falls into 4 categories as following:
   1. unearned revenue: 预收收入，公司在向客户提供服务或商品前收到现金，现金增加，负债同时也增加。当公司提供商品或服务的时候，收入增加，负债减少；
   2. accrued revenue：应记收入，公司在收到现金前提供商品或服务，收入增加，应收账款增加，当客户支付了现金，应收账款减少；
   3. prepaid expenses：预付费用，公司提前支付确定金额的费用，现金【一项资产】减少，预付费用【一项资产】增加，当费用实际发生的时候，预付费用减少而费用增加。
   4. accrued expenses：应记费用，公司拖欠的已经发生的费用，费用增加，作为一项负债的应记费用也增加；当公司支付了之后，负债才会减少。



## Reading 23: Financial Reporting Standards



1. Standard-setting bodies -> Regulatory authorities
   1. FASB US: Financial Accounting Standards Board -> GAAP: Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
   2. IASB: International Accounting Standards Board -> IFRS: International Financial Reporting Standards
2. IASB:
   1. objective: provide financial information that is useful in making decisions about providing resources to an entity;
   2. qualititative characteristics: relevance and faithful representation; comparability, verifiability, timeliness and understandability;
3. measurement base: historical cost, amortized cost, current cost, realizable value, present value, fair value
4. asuumptions about financial statements: accrual accounting, going concern;




## Reading 24: Understanding Income Statement



1. basic equation: `revenues - expenses = net income`, investors use it for valuation purpose, while lenders use it to see whether or not the firm can make the promised profit and payments on its debts. or `net income = revenues - ordinary expenses + other income - other expenses + gains - losses`
   1. revenue: the amounts reported from the sale of goods and services in the normal business;
   2. expense: the amounts incurred to generate revenue and include cost of goods sold, operating expenses, interest and taxes, can be grouped by nature or function, group by function is sometimes referred to as the cost of sales method.
2. multi-step formats:
   1. revenue - cost of goods sold = ***Gross Profit***
   2. gross profit - operating expenses = ***Operating Profit***
   3. operating profit - interest expense = ***Income before Tax***
   4. income before tax -  provision for income tax - earnings from discountinued operations = ***Net Income***
3. revenue recognition: accrual accoutning does not coincide with the receipt of payment of cash, so firms can manipulate net income by recognizing revenue earlier or later or by delaying or accelerating the recognition of expenses
4. special revenue recoginition: sometimes revenue may be recognized before delivery occurs or even after delivery taks places:
   1. long-term contacts: if the outcome of a long-term contract can be estimated, use the ***percentage of completion method***, otherwise, under IFRS, use ***to the extent of contract costs*** method and ***completed contract method*** under GAAP. If a loss is expected, it must be recognized immediately under IFRS and GAAP.
   2. Installment sales: under GAAP, if collectibility is certain, revenue is recognized right now; if can not be reasonable estimated, using ***installment method***, if highly uncertain, using ***cost recovery method***.
   3. barter transaction: under GAAP, revenue from BT can be recognized at fair value if the firm has historically received cash payments for such goods and can use historical experience to determine fair value, otherwise use the carrying value of the asset surrendered; under IFRS, revenue must be based on fair value from similar non-barter transactions with unrelated parties. 
5. firms disclose their revenue recognition policies in the financial statement footnotes.
6. Inventory expenses recognition: if a firm can identify exactly which items were sold and which items remain in inventory, it can use the ***specific identification method***.
   1. FIFO: the cost of inventory acquired first is used to calculate the cost of goods sold, the cost of most recent purchases is used to calculate ending inventory. is appropriate for inventory that has a limited shelf life.
   2. LIFO: appropriate for goods that does not deteriorate with age.
   3. WAC: weighted average cost
   4. FIFO and WAC are both permitted under GAAP and IFRS, LIFO is allowed only under GAAP.
7. depreciation expense recognition:
   1. tangible assets: depreciation; natural resources: depletion; intangible assets: amortization
   2. straight line: SL depreciation expense = (cost - residual value ) / useful life
   3. accelerated depreciation method: speeds up recognition of depreciation in the early years, the ***declining balance method*** applies a constant rate of depreciation to an assets's book value each year, and the most common DB method is ***double-declining balance : DDB*** , which applies 2 times the straight line rate to the declining method: DDB depreciation = (2 / useful life) * (cost - accumulated depreciation)
8. amortization expense recognition:
9. bad debt and warranty expense recognition
10. Non-recurring items:
  1. discontinued operations: measurement date, phaseout period;
  2. unusual or infrequent items: the items are either unusual in nature ***or*** infrequent in occurrence.
  3. extraordinary items: under GAAP, an extraordinary item was a material transaction or event that was ***both*** unusual and infrequent. for periods beginning after 12.5.2015, GAAP no longer allows items to be treated as extraordinary items, IFRS also does not allow items to be treated this way.
11. accounting changes: 
    1. accounting principles: a change in accounting principle requires retrospective application;
    2. accounting estimates: is the result of a change in management's judgment, is applied prospectively and does not require the restatement of prior financial statements;
    3. prior-period adjustments: a change from an incorrect accounting method to one that is accepted under GAAP or IFRS or the correction of an accounting error make in previous financial statements.
12. EPS: basic eps = (net income - preferred dividends) / weighted average number of common shares
13. Diluted EPS: too complex, skip it
14. gross profit margin = gross profit( revenue minus cost of goods sold) / revenue
15. net profit margin = net income / revenue



## Reading 25: Understanding Balance Sheet



1. the balance sheet can be used to assess a firm's liquidity and solvency, and the ability to make distributions to shareholders. liquidity is the ability to meet short-term obligations, solvency is the ability to meet long-term obligations.
2. current assets: cash and other assets that will likely be converted into cash or used up within one year or one operating cycle. it reveals information about the operating activities of the firm.
3. current liabilities: obligations will be satisfied within one year or one operating cycle.
4. working capital = current assets - current liabilities, less may indicate liquidity problem, more indicate inefficient use of assets.
5. noncurrent assets: opposite to current assets, it provide information about the firm's investing activities, which form the foundation upon the firm operates.
6. noncurrent liabilities: provides the firm's long-term financing activities.
7. current assets: 流动资产
   1. cash and cash equivalents: short-term, high liquid investments, are considered financial assets, are reported on the BS at amortized cost or fair value.
   2. marketable securities: financial assets that are traded in a public market.
   3. accounts receivable: are reported at net realizable value, which is based on estimated bad debt expense.
   4. inventories: goods held for sale to customers or used in manufacture of goods to be sold. manufactring firms separately report inventories of raw materials, work-in-progress and finished goods.
   5. other current assets: amounts that may not be material if shown separately, examples include prepaid expenses and deferred tax assets.
8. current liabilities: 流动负债
   1. accounts payable 应付账款: also trade payable, amounts the firm owes to suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit.
   2. notes payable and current portion of long-term debt: 应付票据和当期该偿还的长期负债
   3. accured liabilities: also accured expenses, 应记费用, are expenses that have been recognized in the income statement but are not yet contractually due. include taxes payable, interest payable, wages payable and accrued warranty expense.
   4. unearned revenue: 未实现营收，预收收入，also known as unearned income, deferred revenue or deferred income, is cash collected in advance of providing goods and services.
9. Non-current assets: 非流动资产, property, plant and equipment ( PP&E ), under IFRS, PP&E can be reported using ***cost model*** or ***revaluation model***, under GAAP, only the ***cost model*** can be used.
   1. investment property
   2. intangible assets
   3. goodwill: the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in a business acquisition.
   4. financial assets: financial instruments are measured at historical cost, amortized cost or fair value.
   5. trading sercurities: also known as held-for-trading securities, are reported on BS at fair value, and the unrealized gains and losses are recognized in the IS. Derivative instruments are treated the same as trading securities.
   6. available-for-sale securities: debt and equity that are not expected to be held to maturity or traded in the near term, it's reported on the BS at fair value, but any unrealized gains and losses are not recognized in the IS, are reported in other comprehensive income as a part of shareholders' equity.
10. Non-current liabilities: 非流动负债
  1. long-term financial liabilities: include bank loans, notes payable, bonds payable and derivatives.
  2. deferred tax liabilities: amounts of income taxes payable in future periods as a result of taxable temporary differences.
11. owers' equity: residual interest after subtracting an entity's liabilities. includes contributed capital, preferred stock, treasury stock, retained earnings, non-controlling interest, and accumulated other comprehensive income.
    1. contributed capital: 
    2. preferred stock: can be classified as debt or equity, perpetual preferred stock that is non-redeemable is equity, preferred stock that calls for mandatory redemption in fixed amounts is debt.
    3. noncontrolling interest: minority interest
    4. retained earnings: 
    5. treasury stock: reacquired by the issuing firm but not yet retired, it reduces stockholders' equity.
    6. accumulated other comprehensive income: aggregates net income and certain special transactions that are not reported in the income statement but that affect stockholders' equity.
12. liquidity ratios:
    1. current ratio = current assets / current liabilities
    2. quick ratio (acid test ratio) = ( cash + marketable securities + receivables ) / current liabilities
    3. cash ratio = ( cash + marketable securities ) / current liabilities
13. solvency ratios:
    1. long-term debt-to-equity = long-term debt / total equity
    2. total debt-to-equity = total debt / total equity
    3. debt ratio = total debt / total assets
    4. financial leverage = total assets / total equity 




## Reading 26. Understanding Cash Flow Statements

1. ***CFS*** provides information to assess the firm's liquidity, solvency and financial flexibility.
2. items on the css come from two sources: income statement itmes and changes in bs accounts.
3. A firm's cash receipts and payments can be classified as operating, investing and financing:
   1. ***CFO***: consists of inflows and outflows of cash resulting from transactions that affect a firm's net income.
   2. ***CFI***: consists of flows resulting from the acquisition or disposal of long-term assets and certain invests.
   3. ***CFF***: cosists of flows resulting from transactions affecting a firm's capital structure.
4. Noncash investing and financing activities are not reported in the cash flow statement since they do not result in inflows and outflows of cash. and non cash transactions mush be disclosed in either a footnote or supplement schedule.
5. different items classification of cash flows under GAAP and IFRS:
6. direct and indirect method of presenting CFS: both are permitted under GAAP and IFRS, direct method is encourged. the difference between the two methods relates to the presentation of CFO.
   1. direct method: 把权责制转换成收付实现制， converts an accrual-based income statement into a cash based income statement. the direct method begins with cash inflows from customers and them deduces cash outflows for purchases, operating expenses, interest and taxes. the starting point is the top of the income statement, revenues. it presents the firm's operating cash receipts and payments, which is useful in estimating future operating cash flows.
   2. indrect method: 将净利润转化成经营性现金流, net income is converted to operating cash flow by making adjustments for transactions that affect net income but are not cash transactions. the starting point is net income, the bottom line of the income statement. it focus on the differences in net income and operating cash flow, it provides a useful link to the income statement when forecasting future operating cash flow.
7. linking between cash flow and balance sheet:
   1. cfo + cfg + cfg = changing in cash balance; 
   2. changing in cash balance + beginning cash balance = ending cash balance
   3. beginning accounts receivalbe + sales - cash collection = ending accounts receivable
8. CFO is calculated differently, but the result is the same nder both methods, the calculation of cfi and cff is identical under both methods.
9. Steps in calculating CFO, CFI, CFF in direct method:
   1. CFO
      1. cash collected from customers
      2. cash used in the production of goods and services
      3. cash operating expenses
      4. cash paid for interest
      5. cash paid for taxes
   2. CFI: change in the gross asset accounts that result from investing activities. 
   3. CFF: 
      1. net cash flows from creditors = new borrowings - principal amounts repaid
      2. net cash flows from shareholders = new equity issued - share repurchases - cash dividends paid
10. Steps in calculating CFO, CFI, CFF in indirect method ( example on page 114):
   1. CFO
      1. begin with net income
      2. subtract gains or add losses that resulted from financing or investing cash flows (such as gains from sale of land)
      3. add back all noncash charges to income (such as depreciation and amortization ), and subtract all noncash components of revenue.
      4. add or subtract changes to balance sheet operating accounts as follows:
         1. increases in the operating asset accounts (uses of cash) are subtracted, while decreases (sources of cash) are added;
         2. increases in the operating liability accounts (sources of cash) are added, while decreases (uses of cash) are subtracted.
   2. ***Free cash flow*** is a measure of cash that is available for discretionary purposes.
      1. ***FCFF***: free cash flow to the firm is the cash available to all investors, both equity owners and debt holders. is calculated from net income as : 
         1. FCFF = NI + NCC + ***[Int x (1 - tax rate)]*** - FCInv - WCInv
         2. FCFF = CFO + [Int x (1 - tax rate)] - FCInv
      2. ***FCFE***: Free cash flow to equity is the cash flow that would be available for distribution to common shareholders, ca be calculated as follows:
         1. FCFE = CFO - FCInv + net borrowing
   3. cash flow ratios can be categorized as performance ratios and coverage ratios:
      1. [PR] cash flow to revenue ratio measures the amount of CFO for each dollar of revenue: ***现金收入比：cash flow to revenue = CFO / net revenue***
      2. [PR] cash return-on-assets measures the return of CFO attributed to all providers of capital: ***现在资产比：cash return-on-assets = CFO / average total assets***
      3. [PR] cash return-on-equity ratio measures the return of CFO attributed to shareholders: ***现金权益比：cash return-on-equity = CFO / average total equity***
      4. [PR] cash to income ratio measures the ability to generate cash from firm operations: ***现金收益比：cash to income = CFO / operating income***
      5. [PR] cash flow per share is a variation of basic earnings per share measured by using CFO instead of net income: ***每股现金流：cash flow per share = (CFO - preferred dividends ) / (weighted average number of common shares)***
      6. [CR] debt coverage ratio measures financial risk and leverage: ***负债保障系数：debt coverage = CFO / total debts***
      7. [CR] interest coverage ratio measures the firm's ability to meet its interest obligations: ***利息保障倍数：interest coverage = (CFO + interest paid + taxes paid) / interest paid***
      8. [CR] reinvestment ratio measures the firm's ability to acquire long-term assets with operating cash flow: ***再投资比率： reinvestment = CFO / cash paid to long-term assets***
      9. [CR] debt payment ratio measures the firm's ability to satisfy long-term debt with operating cash flow: ***负债偿还倍数：debt payment = CFO / cash long-term debt repayment***
      10. [CR] dividend payment ratio measures the firm's ability to make dividend payments from operating cash flow: ***股利支付倍数：dividend payment = CFO / dividends paid***
      11. [CR] investing and financing ratio measures the firm's ability to purchase assets, satisfy debts and pay dividends: ***投融资比率：investing and financing = CFO / cash outflows from investing and financing activities***
