## reading 24: Understanding Income Statement



1. basic equation: `revenues - expenses = net income`, investors use it for valuation purpose, while lenders use it to see whether or not the firm can make the promised profit and payments on its debts. or `net income = revenues - ordinary expenses + other income - other expenses + gains - losses`
   1. revenue: the amounts reported from the sale of goods and services in the normal business;
   2. expense: the amounts incurred to generate revenue and include cost of goods sold, operating expenses, interest and taxes, can be grouped by nature or function, group by function is sometimes referred to as the cost of sales method.
2. multi-step formats:
   1. revenue - cost of goods sold = ***Gross Profit***
   2. gross profit - operating expenses = ***Operating Profit***
   3. operating profit - interest expense = ***Income before Tax***
   4. income before tax -  provision for income tax - earnings from discountinued operations = ***Net Income***
3. revenue recognition: accrual accoutning does not coincide with the receipt of payment of cash, so firms can manipulate net income by recognizing revenue earlier or later or by delaying or accelerating the recognition of expenses
4. special revenue recoginition: sometimes revenue may be recognized before delivery occurs or even after delivery taks places:
   1. long-term contacts: if the outcome of a long-term contract can be estimated, use the ***percentage of completion method***, otherwise, under IFRS, use ***to the extent of contract costs*** method and ***completed contract method*** under GAAP. If a loss is expected, it must be recognized immediately under IFRS and GAAP.
   2. Installment sales: under GAAP, if collectibility is certain, revenue is recognized right now; if can not be reasonable estimated, using ***installment method***, if highly uncertain, using ***cost recovery method***.
   3. barter transaction: under GAAP, revenue from BT can be recognized at fair value if the firm has historically received cash payments for such goods and can use historical experience to determine fair value, otherwise use the carrying value of the asset surrendered; under IFRS, revenue must be based on fair value from similar non-barter transactions with unrelated parties. 
5. firms disclose their revenue recognition policies in the financial statement footnotes.
6. Inventory expenses recognition: if a firm can identify exactly which items were sold and which items remain in inventory, it can use the ***specific identification method***.
   1. FIFO: the cost of inventory acquired first is used to calculate the cost of goods sold, the cost of most recent purchases is used to calculate ending inventory. is appropriate for inventory that has a limited shelf life.
   2. LIFO: appropriate for goods that does not deteriorate with age.
   3. WAC: weighted average cost
   4. FIFO and WAC are both permitted under GAAP and IFRS, LIFO is allowed only under GAAP.
7. depreciation expense recognition:
